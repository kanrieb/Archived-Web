#Personal Website

This website was created by me to act as a sort of virtual resume.
I will do my best to update it with projects and experiences, to make sure that it remains current. 
I have done my best to give credit to the resppective writers of code snippets that I used.
Feel free to look around, and contact me with any advice, comments, or concerns (I am still working on making it browser compatible).
