							<p class="desc">JEA is a pension systems company that provides custom pension solutions to their clients.
							During my time at JEA I was assigned to the PENFAX project, which involved manipulating databases with 
								information on thousands of users, updating code to fit client requirements, and ADF interface development. 
							I was placed on a Scrum team and completed tickets for each sprint cycle.
							It was a great environmet to work with more senior developers, and I learned a lot about larger company 
								code standards.
							Technical skills I used for this co-op were branching and committing with SVN, writing and executing 
								SQL scripts, and performing basic operations in Oracle ADF.

                                        		<p class="desc"> For this co-op position, I was hired by the security team for the UVIC Faculty of Engineering. 
								 I was given various tasks to complete, but my largest project was creating a password security tool 
									that would track the age of passwords, and corresponding risk levels of Engineering faculty accounts. 
								 This tool displayed any publically-known security breaches that any faculty email address may have been
									involved in by running a nightly query with all the faculty accounts against an API and then entering 
									the data into a database.
								This tool is actually still being used by the Engineering faculty and staff to monitor account security status.
								Through this task I learned the importance of requirements analysis and design functionality.
								Technical skills I used for this co-op were PHP/HTML/JS/CSS web design and running complex SQL queries 
									for large databases.

								As my first co-op, I will never forget my experience working at Science Venture.
								This co-op term involved working with a large team of other people to plan and deliver STEM workshops to 
									schools and foster excitment in young students about science.	
								Over the summer we travelled to multiple schools per week all over the Greater Victoria area, and later
									hosted summer camps that we had to completely design ourselves.
								I learned valuable teamwork, organization, time-management, public speaking and communication 
									skills that I use in my life to this day.
